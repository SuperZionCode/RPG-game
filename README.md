# RPG-game
I made this game when I was younger using Gamemaker and Game Maker Language(a javascript environment)
I wrote all the code and drew all the sprites myself. My friend helped make the music.
Please use arrow keys to move, and "ZXC" to use weapons, magic and items respectively.
The game is very challenging.
If I could make it again, I would add more nuance to the combat and also try to make the combat fairer.
